An App-Project that started as small & simple hobby (in early 2009) has developed into an All-In-One solution in a
period of more than 10 years.

<span class="shot">![shot1](/assets/img/gpsl/Screenshot_1642149089_50.png)</span>

GPSLogger II does what you can guess quite simple by its ordinary name. The application can record the physical movement
of your Android Device over time. What you probably might not be able to guess are the additional features GPSLogger can
offer to you.

But before going into further details - location information is very sensitive information - nobody **excepts you**
should know where you are (or where you have been). GPSLogger II is fully respecting your privacy. All data the app is
recording will remain **on the device only** and you are the **only person who decides what is going to happen with your
data**. As Developer of the app I do all I can in order to be as transparent as possible what the app is doing.

If you have any questions - please do not hesitate to ask!

Every permission the app is requesting will hopefully be explained in a reasonable manner. If you have any doubts,
please deny the app request. In such a case, please open the Permissions section of the GPSLogger manual that can be
found at [https://www.emacberry.com/gpsl/app-permissions.html](https://www.emacberry.com/gpsl/app-permissions.html) and
read more details about the permission requests. Only grant the permission if you feel comfortable to do so.

The list of application features is quite long, and it is impossible to describe in detail all the functionalities here
in the overview. You can find a detailed description of every aspect in the GPSLogger II manual that is located at
[https://www.emacberry.com/gpsl/manual.html](https://www.emacberry.com/gpsl/manual.html).

If you have any remarks or suggestions for improvements (yes - more features!) - I am very happy to hear from you.

your personal preferences, the application settings list is really long and can look very complex for the start. There
are **over 400 different settings** you can adjust. The GPSLogger Manual will guide you through the different settings
sections that can be adjusted for a specific feature.

# My personal GPSLogger Use Cases {#myusage}
Why GPSLogger is build in the way it is?

> I truly believe that you should use the software that you build by yourself on a daily basis. Actually I started with
> the app because on the Blackberry Platform there was nothing that I wanted (in the year 2009) - so I began with my
> own solution. When RIM decided to drop the Java based platform (and moved over to BlackBerry OS10 (the beginning of
> the end), I moved over to Android. There has been plenty of other apps available already, but you might guess it, none
> of them offered the features I wanted to have (or I simply did not searched hard enough). GPSLogger for Android was
> released in Aug. 2016 for the first time via Google Play Store.
> 
> Please find below my four main use cases, with a brief feature list. You will find detailed descriptions about each of
> the functionalities in the [corresponding manual sections](/gpsl/docs/1000-intro.html). Of course this are just **my
> personal** use cases - you can use it for much more - there is plenty of feedback what users do with GPSLogger and I
> would be very happy to hear form your use cases too!
 
## Primary
Automated logging of my casual road bike cycle activities following a planed route (including multiple climbs) or just
keep track of the commute sessions using:
- AutoSTART when I am leaving home/work
- Make use of the Barometer Sensor to capture realistic elevation profiles
- Recording additionally to my position my heart rate, cadence, left & right power and shifting events
- Using OFFLINE OpenStreetMap data (*.map files)
- Announcements of Turn Instructions and upcoming climbs
- Interval Text to speech announcements for total distance, total time, sector time, average speed and remaining
  distance and climb-meters every 5 km
- Automatically switch to ClimbView when approaching a climb on my route
- Requesting "when and what's the next turn" via my Di2
- Enjoying real MSL elevation information
- Keep my wife happy by letting her know where I am (when my ride takes longer then 2 hours)
- Controlling via my Di2 shifting levers the playback of my music I am sometimes listening (on my bone conduction
  headphones)
- In case of a closed/blocked street: using the detour functionality
- Intense usage of the _ShutUp_ function
- When I am cycling alone: capture BTLE Beacons
- AutoSTOP when arriving at home/work
- Text to Speech Summary
- AutoUpload to Strava

## Secondary
Automated logging my local hiking activities - quickly change the profile to 'hiking' & enjoying functionalities:
- AutoSTART when I am leaving home
- Make use of the Barometer Sensor to capture realistic elevation profiles
- Using OFFLINE OpenStreetMap data (*.map files)
- Interval Text to speech announcements for sector time & average speed every kilometer
- When I am walking alone: capture BTLE Beacons
- AutoSTOP when I am arriving at home
- Text to Speech Summary
- AutoUpload to Strava
From time to time I also use the navigation features when hiking

## Tertiary
Manual Indoor-Run or Indoor-Rowing Sessions - quickly change to the corresponding profile and use:
- Simulate the run of any real-outdoor route
- Interval Text to speech announcements for sector time & average speed every kilometer
- Text to Speech Summary
- AutoUpload to Strava

## Quaternary
Manual logging of flights (when it was possible to travel) or long travel by train or car (obviously also with a
different profile) and enjoy:
- Make use of the Barometer Sensor to capture realistic elevation profiles
- Using OFFLINE OpenStreetMap data (*.map files)
- NO AutoUpload to Strava because I am exceeding the maximum average speed

> Since I mentioned it already multiple times - If you like you can [follow me on <i class="fa-brands fa-strava"></i> Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/6147866).

# History - Initial BlackBerry Version
> For what ever reason I could not throw it all over board
> <br/>**THIS INFORMATION IS OUTDATED**

GPSLogger II is a pretty straightforward application – it records your physical movement on your BlackBerry® device over
time. The recorded information includes, beside your actual location data in WGS84, the elevation, your speed and some
additional data. You can select between imperial, metric or nautical units.

The location information can be displayed on a plain canvas or GPSLogger II can make use of BlackBerryMaps (if
installed) to display your movement on a map. Please note when you make use of BlackBerry Maps that this can imply
additional data charges.

Additionally, GPSLogger II can direct you to a location that you either entered manually or have previously recorded (
via the "Guide Me Home" function). This can be quite useful whether you want to locate your car in a big parking lot or
you are in the wilderness and have lost your orientation.

As extended functionality to the "Guide Me Home" feature a very easy to use outdoor navigation is integrated into
GPSLogger II also. As latest addon you can use GPSLogger II also as LapTimer - a very powerful feature for all who need
to keep track of intermediate timings.

The most important aspect of GPSLogger II is that it will work 100% offline - no data will be transferred while you use
it (except when the BlackBerryMap view is used).

### Features

- Record your movement over time - the following values will be stored:
  - longitude / latitude
  - accuracy for longitude & latitude values
  - \# of satellites
  - current altitude (in WGS84)
  - current course/heading
  - current speed
  - name of location (if specified)
- Display of the current data in various views:
  - Path View: Displays the traveled path in an x/y coordinate system (2D-View) [^1]
  - Elevation View: Displays the change of altitude over time [^1]
  - Speed View: Displays the change of speed over time [^1]
  - GPS View: Displays longitude, latitude, heading and speed in a large font (e.g. for your own navigation)
  - Timing View: Displays elapsed time, current speed and Ø speed in a large font (e.g. for runners and cyclists) [^1]
  - Compass View: Displays the current heading in a nice compass view [^2] [^3] [^6]
  - Direction View: Shows an arrow/line that points into the direction of stored location (according to your current
    heading) [^3] [^4] [^5] [^6]
- Outdoor navigation (incl. ETA) -> see documentation for details
- "Guide me Home"-Function for people who easily loose orientation like myself ;-) (see 'Direction View')
  To reach the destination you have stored, travel in the direction of the arrow on the device. If the arrow is pointing
  up, you are traveling in the correct direction to reach your selected destination. If the arrow is pointing down, you
  are traveling away from the selected destination. This makes GPSLogger II also suitable for Geocaching! [^3] [^4] [^5]
  [^6]
- Lap Timer functionality
- Zoom IN & Zoom OUT for path, elevation and speed views
- "Distance Alerts/Signal" - the device can peep & vibrate after a user-specified distance (in meters or feet) was
  traveled (especially useful for runners & bikers)
- Night Mode in 4 different colors (yellow, blue, red and green)
- Save current location to use it later with the "Guide me..."-Function
- Store current location on the Clipboard (e.g. to paste it into an SMS or eMail)
- Support for wildlife tracking/recording (with the option to select from predefined location names)
- Load and display a previously recorded path
- Summarize information about a previously recorded path
- Export recorded paths into CSV, GPX, KML (GoogleEarth) formats (and send it via email if you wish)
- Import a path in GPX or KML format (e.g. that are recorded with other applications that support GPX-Export or have
  been downloaded from websites like GPSies.com [^7]

### Reviews (of the initial BlackBerry Version)
#### Ryan Blundell 2009/06/02 \[from [http://www.crackberry.com](http://www.crackberry.com)\]
>**GPSLogger - a Free BlackBerry App to Track your Movement**
>
>GPSLogger is a free application that essentially enables you to help you get where you are going and track where you
>have been. The application will also help you remember places that you have visited; perhaps a new hang out or a
>location of a movie set you accidentally stumbled upon. Now, hopefully you don't get lost on the way to the rest of the
>review.
>
>**Destination: the conclusion**
>An amazing array of features, numerous log and file options, multiple ways to view the information. All this and more
>can be found in this FREE app. I was thoroughly impressed with GPSLogger's offerings.

#### Ronen Halevy 2009/03/13 \[from [http://www.berryreview.com](http://www.berryreview.com)\]
>**GPSLogger – Free App Records Your Movements Using GPS (GPX Or KML)**
>
>Emacf1 released another free/donationware application recently called GPSLogger. It is a simple offline GPS logging
>application that records your movements using GPS. The nice part is that unlike other applications it stores it on your
>BlackBerry, so it does not have an online component. This appeals to my security conscious side that just wants to track
>my trip or hike without sharing…

[^1]: requires that the devices is actually logging (this means a path will be recorded)

[^2]: only available for BlackBerry® devices with OS4.6 or higher (SVG-support required)

[^3]: since BlackBerry® devices (before OS7.x) come without a compass, this function requires that you move around so
    the current heading can be calculated from the GPS data

[^4]: requires that you have loaded a previously saved location

    or
    
    when logging, this function will always guide you into the direction of the first recorded location of your current
    path (your start location)

[^5]: this function is not a navigation replacement - you will be guided into the direction of a previously stored
    location. It does not take natural barriers like rivers or canyons into account.

[^6]: thanks to Rob Antonishen for the very nice compass SVG file

[^7]: minimal requirements for a location stored in the GPX file are: longitude, latitude, and timestamp information
