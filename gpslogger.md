GPSLogger II is a pretty straightforward application – it records your physical movement on your BlackBerry® device over
time. The recorded information includes, beside your actual location data in WGS84, the elevation, your speed and some
additional data. You can select between imperial, metric or nautical units.

The location information can be displayed on a plain canvas or GPSLogger II can make use of BlackBerryMaps (if
installed) to display your movement on a map. Please note when you make use of BlackBerry Maps that this can imply
additional data charges.

Additionally, GPSLogger II can direct you to a location that you either entered manually or have previously recorded (
via the "Guide Me Home" function). This can be quite useful whether you want to locate your car in a big parking lot or
you are in the wilderness and have lost your orientation.

As extended functionality to the "Guide Me Home" feature a very easy to use outdoor navigation is integrated into
GPSLogger II also. As latest addon you can use GPSLogger II also as LapTimer - a very powerful feature for all who need
to keep track of intermediate timings.

The most important aspect of GPSLogger II is that it will work 100% offline - no data will be transferred while you use
it (except when the BlackBerryMap view is used).

## Features
- Record your movement over time - the following values will be stored:
    - longitude / latitude
    - accuracy for longitude & latitude values
    - \# of satellites
    - current altitude (in WGS84)
    - current course/heading
    - current speed
    - name of location (if specified)
- Display of the current data in various views:
    - Path View: Displays the traveled path in a x/y coordinate system (2D-View) [^1]
    - Elevation View: Displays the change of altitude over time [^1]
    - Speed View: Displays the change of speed over time [^1]
    - GPS View: Displays longitude, latitude, heading and speed in a large font (e.g. for your own navigation)
    - Timing View: Displays elapsed time, current speed and Ø speed in a large font (e.g. for runners and cyclists) [^1]
    - Compass View: Displays the current heading in a nice compass view [^2] [^3] [^6]
    - Direction View: Shows an arrow/line that points into the direction of stored location (according to your current
      heading) [^3] [^4] [^5] [^6]
- Outdoor navigation (incl. ETA) -> see documentation for details
- "Guide me Home"-Function for people who easily loose orientation like myself ;-) (see 'Direction View')
  To reach the destination you have stored, travel in the direction of the arrow on the device. If the arrow is pointing
  up, you are traveling in the correct direction to reach your selected destination. If the arrow is pointing down, you
  are traveling away from the selected destination. This makes GPSLogger II also suitable for Geocaching! [^3] [^4] [^5]

- Lap Timer functionality
- Zoom IN & Zoom OUT for path, elevation and speed views
- "Distance Alerts/Signal" - the device can peep & vibrate after a user-specified distance (in meters or feet) was
  traveled (especially useful for runners & bikers)
- Night Mode in 4 different colors (yellow, blue, red and green)
- Save current location to use it later with the "Guide me..."-Function
- Store current location on the Clipboard (e.g. to paste it into a SMS or eMail)
- Support for wildlife tracking/recording (with the option to select from predefined location names)
- Load and display a previously recorded path
- Summarize information about a previously recorded path
- Export recorded paths into CSV, GPX, KML (GoogleEarth) formats (and send it via email if you wish)
- Import a path in GPX or KML format (e.g. that are recorded with other applications that support GPX-Export or have
  been downloaded from websites like GPSies.com [^7]
  
## Reviews (of the initial BlackBerry Version)
### Ryan Blundell 2009/06/02 \[from [http://www.crackberry.com](http://www.crackberry.com)\]
**GPSLogger - a Free BlackBerry App to Track your Movement**

GPSLogger is a free application that essentially enables you to help you get where you are going and track where you
have been. The application will also help you remember places that you have visited; perhaps a new hang out or a
location of a movie set you accidentally stumbled upon. Now, hopefully you don't get lost on the way to the rest of the
review.

**Destination: the conclusion**
An amazing array of features, numerous log and file options, multiple ways to view the information. All this and more
can be found in this FREE app. I was thoroughly impressed with GPSLogger's offerings.

**GPSLogger – Free App Records Your Movements Using GPS (GPX Or KML)**

Emacf1 released another free/donationware application recently called GPSLogger. It is a simple offline GPS logging
application that records your movements using GPS. The nice part is that unlike other applications it stores it on your
BlackBerry so it does not have an online component. This appeals to my security conscious side that just wants to track
my trip or hike without sharing…

[^1]: requires that the devices is actually logging (this means a path will be recorded)

[^2]: only available for BlackBerry® devices with OS4.6 or higher (SVG-support required)

[^3]: since BlackBerry® devices (before OS7.x) come without a compass, this function requires that you move around so
    the current heading can be calculated from the GPS data

[^4]: requires that you have loaded a previously saved location

    or
    
    when logging, this function will always guide you into the direction of the first recorded location of your current
    path (your start location)

[^5]: this function is not a navigation replacement - you will be guided into the direction of a previously stored
    location. It does not take natural barriers like rivers or canyons into account.

[^6]: thanks to Rob Antonishen for the very nice compass SVG file

[^7]: minimal requirements for a location stored in the GPX file are: longitude, latitude, and timestamp information
