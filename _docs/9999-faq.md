# Answers

## How can I change the current view? {#swipe}
> If the TabBar is not visible (either you have disabled it in the options or hidden because you are using multiple
> views), you can swipe left/right in order to change the current view. Please additionally note, that on the map view
> you have to start with the swiping near the left/right margin of the map screen.

## Stop logging is not possible - the <i class="fa-solid fa-circle-stop"></i> **stop logging** overlay button now shown {#locked}
> GPSLogger's main screen can be active/display all it's information, even if your device is in the 
> <i class="fa-solid fa-lock"></i> locked state. This will save you from constantly unlocking your phone when you just
> want to check your location on the map.
> 
> In order to avoid the situation, that you terminate the logging process by accident while the phone is located in your
> pocked (or stored somewhere else), the <i class="fa-solid fa-circle-stop"></i> **stop logging** overlay button is only
> active, when the device is in <i class="fa-solid fa-lock-open"></i> unlocked state.
> 
> So when you take your phone out of your pocked, and you want to stop the logging process (and the

## The Application is always _talking_ - How to disable all Text2Speech audio announcements? {#shutup}
> I am sorry that you dislike this feature - but as _always_ there is a simple way to disable the _lady from talking_: 
> Open Application Settings > Speech & Audio Notifications > <i class="fa-solid fa-toggle-off"></i> Make use of speech synthesis
>
> Before disabling the feature completely you might like to disable specific announcements only - all details can be
> found in the [Audio Announcements section](../3010-audioalerts/). 

## Where do I find my exported file? {#exports}
> Please see [access GPSLogger files](../5000-export/#access-exported-files-in-the-share-folder)

## Settings are so complicated & complex? {#settings}
> What should I say - yes you are right, the settings seams to be quite complex and might be way too complicated for the
> start. The main reason why the situation is what it is: I don't want to restrict the users in any kind nor do I want
> to make decisions for them - I truly believe you as a user are intelligent and tweak all the different options to your
> personal optimum. Have in mind we are all different and have different background and plenty of different use cases.

## Why the App need's the Permission...? {#permissions}
> You find a detailed description about the different requested permissions [in the Section _nformation about requested
> Application Permissions_](../1000-intro/#permissions) - If you have any additional question - please do not hesitate
> to ask!

## Why should I disable the OS battery optimization for the app? {#why-battery-optimization}
> The Android OS have different possibilities to extend the battery life of your device - one of these possibilities is
> to restrict the ability to allow apps to make use of the running-as-background-service capabilities. Since GPSLogger
> is doing all of it's [logging functionality as a **background service**](../1100-data/#service) such a restriction
> will be counterproductive (if not causing fatal errors).
> 
> It might be possible to use the app with **enabled battery optimization** - but it can't be guaranteed that longer
> activities will be recorded completely/correctly. It's strongly recommend disabling this optimization. 

## How to disable the OS battery optimization for the app? {#how2-battery-optimization}
> When starting GPSLogger you will be initially prompted to disable the battery optimization from the OS for the app.
> If you have ignored this request/prompt, then you have two different options:<br/>
- Open the InApp Settings > General Settings > <i class="fa-solid fa-toggle-on"></i> Prioritized Background Activity
  <br/>...and then selecting _Allow_ when asked _Let app always run in background?_<br/>
  <span class="shot">![disable-battery-optimization](/assets/img/gpsl/backg002.png)</span><br class="shot-end">
>
- Open the OS Settings > _App_ > select _GPSLogger II_ > Battery > select _Unrestricted_
  <br/><br/>**or** (depending on your OS version)<br/><br/>
- Open the OS Settings > _Battery_ > select in the menu the &nbsp;<i class="fa-solid fa-ellipsis-vertical"></i>&nbsp;
  and then _Battery optimization_ > select _All apps_ > select _GPSLogger II_ > select _Don't optimize_<br/>
> 
If you don't have the **Prioritized Background Activity** switch in the GPSLogger application setting, then you OS
version probably don't optimize the battery usage of apps (and so there is no need to disable it).  

## Opening Web Links with GPSLogger using Android 11 (or earlier) {#weblinks}
> Normally it should not be required to adjust anything in oder that GPSLogger will open the registered weblinks in the
> Application - nevertheless - if this does not work on your device running under Android 4,5,6,7,8,9 or 10 then:<br/>
> <span class="shot">![weblink handling](/assets/img/gpsl/web-link-01.png)</span>
> Open the GPSLogger application settings of your Android (not the build in GPSLogger settings!) - Typically this can
> be done by opening the Settings App and then there is a section called **Apps** or **Applications**. Open the
> GPSLogger App settings and then select the **Open by default** Section
> <br class="shot-end">
> <span class="shot">![weblink handling](/assets/img/gpsl/web-link-02.png)</span>
> <span class="shot">![weblink handling](/assets/img/gpsl/web-link-03.png)</span>
> This will show you (hopefully) the following dialog. Please make sure that either **Open in this app** or
> **Ask every time** is selected.
> <br class="shot-end">
> Additionally it could be that another app (e.g. your browser) have already _registered itself_ as default handler for
> a certain weblink/type.  
> <span class="shot">![weblink handling](/assets/img/gpsl/web-link-04.png)</span>
In oder to check/clear this registration, open the system application settings of the
> corresponding app (here in the example the _Chrome browser_)
> <br class="shot-end">
> So now you should be able to open any of the [registered weblinks](../1000-intro/#reg-weblinks) directly with
> GPSLogger (or at least the OS should show you a selection dialog which app should be used to open the link). 

## Opening Web Links with GPSLogger using Android 12 (or later) {#weblinks-sdk31}
> I really love Google for all the changes that have been introduced with Android 11 (SDK 30). Not only that you are no
longer able to read/save data in the file system - also using your app with web-links have been massively limited.
Even if I understand the reasons for these changes - it making things that has been convenient for the users some sort
of complicated.

## My device does not show a dialog (to allow to select the GPSLogger app) when starting a download on openandromaps! (or directly start to download of the file with the used browser) {#openopenandro}
> Using Android 12 (or later):
- In order to be able to open download links from openandromaps with GPSLogger you **need to enable the corresponding
  URL's in the OS application Settings section** (Open by default > Links to open in this app). So please enable/add:
> 
  - download.openandromaps.org
  - ftp.gwdg.de<br/><br/>
>  
  please see [FAQ: Using Weblinks in Android 12 (or later)](./#weblinks-sdk31) for details
>
> Using Android 11 (or earlier):
- please see [FAQ: Using Weblinks in Android 11 (or earlier)](./#weblinks) for details

## I have a setting with the prefix \[Profile!\] that is not editable {#multiprofile}
> This prefix indicates, that a) you have currently activated a different profile and b) that the setting have a
> pendant in the _Multi Preferences/Mode_. So when ever you come across such a setting field, you should switch to
> Application Settings > Multi Preferences/Mode and select the current active profile to adjust it.
