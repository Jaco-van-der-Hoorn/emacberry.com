# Overview

<span class="shot">![view-shifting](/assets/img/gpsl/view-shifting-di2.png)</span>
Since April 2019 GPSLogger shas supported Shimano Di2 D-Fly Channel communication via the wireless modules EW-WU101 or
EW-WU111 \[requires firmware v4.5.2 (or higher)\].

When you own a wireless module for your Di2 you can now add your device via the _additional ANT+ & BluetoothLE Sensor_
settings - simply press any button of your Di2 (to ensure that it's powered on) and then start the Search for BluetoothLE
Devices within the GPSLogger settings. Once your shifting is found and added you will find a new settings menu called 
_Di2 Settings_ which will open the Box of Pandora!

GPSLogger II can log each shifting event and include the data in the FIT file format exports (currently Strava does
not support shift events - but sites like [http://di2stats.com](http://di2stats.com) do).

Please note that it might be required to adjust the gears in the Di2 Settings to your actual bike setup - if you want to
bind multiple bikes equipped with Di2 to GPSLogger you can switch between them via the multi-sport profiles. GPSLogger
allows binding different actions (like media player controls) to the 4 available D-Fly channels (you can configure the
different buttons of your Di2 shifters to D-Fly channels via the E-Tube app of Shimano).

And of course there is a main view available that display the current gears and the resulting gear ratio. To make the
initial setup as easy as possible a wizard has been added that you can start from the app main menu.

# Single Click, Double Click & Long Click (aka _Tab & Hold_)

Having up to four different D-Fly channels is nice - but in GPSLogger you can have up
to three different actions for each possible shifter button - which allows you to have up to **12 different actions** that can be triggered from your Di2:

| single click | press and release the shifter button instantly (short-click) |
| double click | perform two _single click's_ shortly after each other - I do admit that this requires some practise to get use to the timing - the two clicks have to be performed with a pause no longer then 850 milliseconds |
| long click | press and hold the shifter button for longer then 1 second |
