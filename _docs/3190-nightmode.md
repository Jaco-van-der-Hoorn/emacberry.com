# Toggle between _Light/Day & Dark/Night_ Mode

<span class="shot">![view-multiview](/assets/img/gpsl/nightmode.png)</span>
In most of modern GUIs you can select between a light & dark theme - initially the dark mode of GPSLogger started under
the term _night mode_. The functionality remains the same - instead of the bright white background you can switch to
all-black display. This black-background make the app way more eye friendly when you use the app during nighttime.

You can toggle between _Day & Night Mode_ via the  <i class="fa-solid fa-ellipsis-vertical"></i>  main menu of
the app.

When you dislike the opacity level of the map in dark/night mode, there are some good news for you - there in a setting
to adjust it. Open Application Settings > Appearance & Startup > Map & Path View Settings > Map opacity (night). The
default value is _half_, but you can select between full, 4/5, 3/4, half and 1/4. Where _full_ does not dim the map at
all and the _1/4_ will give you a bare vision of the map (but it really depends on your use case).<br class="shot-end">

Beside the Map opacity there are additional settings available to configure the _Night Mode_ behaviour:
- Binding Night Mode to OS DarkMode
- Start application in Night Mode
- Specify the Night Mode ColorScheme

You find these options in Application Settings > Appearance & Startup > Font size & Display options... > Night Mode Options

Binding Night Mode to your OS DarkMode will automatically toggle between day & night mode of the app when you toggle
between default & _Dark_ theme of your Android. Enabling the binding will disable the option to start GPSLogger in Night
Mode by default.

## Dark/Night Mode ColorScheme

Since there is not the perfect dark mode color, you can choose any RGB-Color the palette of your device is offering.
Feel free to play around with the color chooser and find your perfect night color for you.
