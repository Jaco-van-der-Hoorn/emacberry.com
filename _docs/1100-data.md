# How GPSLogger will log your data?
The core idea since the initial version of the app is, that it does not have to be actively running _with a visible
screen_ while recording. You should be able to use your device for something else - or simply carrying the device in your
pocket or bag/backpack while GPSLogger is logging the data.

## <i class="fa-solid fa-gear"></i> Running as Android-Background Service {#service}
By default, an application have certain amount of screens (called GUI) and the code is running when the so called
_Activity_ is visible for the user. Even if GPSLogger have also such GUI part [as mainly described here](../1200-views/)
the main recording work will be done running in an _Android-Background Service_.

<span class="shot">![background-service](/assets/img/gpsl/service-notification.png)</span>
Starting a Background Service on Android requires that the code running will show the user always a (sticky)
notification.  Please note, that it was not my design decision to make this notification _sticky_!

This is a requirement for all 3'rd party apps running on Android (to make it possible for the user to realize that
something is running in the background) - needless to say that Google makes an exception when it comes to apps/services
they run themselves on your phone.  

### <span class="material-icons">info</span> Information for Android 7 (or later)
The Android OS have different possibilities to extend the battery life of your device - one of these possibilities is to
restrict the ability to allow apps to make use of the running-as-background-service capabilities. Of course such a
restriction will be counterproductive when using GPSLogger. So the app is requesting you to **disable the OS battery
optimization for GPSLogger** in multiple ways. For details see the FAQ:
[How to disable OS battery optimization](../1900-faq/#how2-battery-optimization)
<br class="shot-end">

## <i class="fa-solid fa-battery-three-quarters"></i> GPSLogger is designed to be battery friendly
Battery lives matters - that's one of the core principles that drives me, during the development of the application. As
developer, you have influence on the overall energy consumption of a device. So all parts of the applications have been
designed in a way to make the code as energy efficient as possible (this means to use very simple structures and almost
no frameworks).

> Just as one example: GPSLogger don't use an internal database while logging, instead the data will be directly written
on your device. This makes the code a bit more complex, but on the other hand side this saves a lot of CPU-cycles (and
> with that plenty of energy will be saved).

The majority of the battery-usage of the app (while logging in the background) is caused by requesting & receiving the
GPS-signal. So by adjusting the [**GPS-update interval** in the application settings](../8000-general/#gps-settings) you
have a direct influence on the overall battery-consumption of the application - adjust it to your use case!

Have also in mind that different sensors might use additional energy - my personal observation is, that using the build
in magnetic sensor (aka compass) of my current Pixel3 phone have an almost insane negative impact on the overall battery
life - while the intense usage of the barometer sensor seams to have almost no impact. So the total battery consumption
really depends on your hardware and the settings (update frequency) you are using.

And without going too much into details here - since you might like to use different update-intervals for different use
cases the app offers a [Multi Preferences/Modes Feature](../3950-multipref) allowing you to adjust quick & easily the
settings. 

## <i class="fa-solid fa-file-code"></i> Data is stored '_as it is_' (raw)
GPSLogger is following a very simply (but strict) principle: **always keep the original data!** It's almost the nature
of GPS (and other sensor) data to be a bit flaky. It can be required for certain use-cases to apply some optimizations
(like smoothing values over a certain time period). But you don't have to be afraid, there are two very important things
you should know:

1. All calculations/manipulations will happen after the **raw source data** have been captured and stored inside the GPL
   file. So all optimizations will always happen afterward - the original data will never be altered/modified!<br/><br/>
   This ensures that when ever something will be messed up inside the application (e.g. cause of a bug) it can be
   **always** be fixed with update of the GPSLogger application!

2. All possible data post-processing can be disabled via the application setting (or needs to be enabled by the user at
   the first place). IMHO it's essential that the user can decide **if** and when **how** the sensor data should be
   manipulated. GPSLogger is **no BLACKBOX<span class="material-icons">help_center</span>** nor it does any
   **miracles <i class="fa-solid fa-wand-magic-sparkles"></i>** - If you have a question - do not hesitate to ask!

## <i class="fa-solid fa-link-slash"></i> Sensor data will be logged independent of each other {#independant}
Even if it might not make a big difference for the user - but in case you are technically interested: GPSLogger stores
the data/fields for each supported sensor as separate/different _record-type_. By following this approach, it's quite
easy to introduce new sensor types/data without invalidating any existing files.

When multiple sensors provide their measurement at the same time, the app creates multiple entries (obviously of a
different type and with different data) and queue it in a synchronous writing process. 

## <i class="fa-solid fa-stopwatch"></i> <span class="material-icons">high_quality</span> Recording with a resolution of one millisecond
Even if most (if not all) website processing location based information have a minimum resolution of **one second**
GPSLogger stores and process all it's data with a precision of **one millisecond**. This additional precision caused
serveral issues (e.g. when you upload data to sites like <i class="fa-brands fa-strava"></i> Strava) - but at the end of
the day these challenges are solved.

My assumption is, that the source of this one-second-limitation is, that _a)_ most available GPS providers will not
provide data more frequent and _b)_ a lot of common sport activity tracking hardware (like sport watches or bike
computers) have the same one-second-resolution (probably cause of hardware limitations).

This resolution is also present in some quite popular file formats, like
[Garmins FIT format](https://developer.garmin.com/fit) or TCX (where the fields of the type _dateTime_ has also only the
resolution of one second).

I am convinced that this **difference matters**! (might be not such a big surprise, since I have implemented it)

In the past few years I have developed some sort of passion for riding with my road bike. While cycling, I'm typically
pushing the pedals with a cadence greater than 60 revs per minute. With other words in one second I do more than a
single rotation of the crank. When I additionally process data from a power-meter (pedals) then it's IMHO essential to
know in which fraction of a second a certain power value was provided - specially when reading power-meter data from
left and right pedal individually (what I actually do).

So for me, it's a bit difficult to understand, how almost the complete world is accepting this one-second-limitation -
especially when reviewing/comparing different power-meters (based on data recorded with 'BLACKBOX' Garmin bike computers
and exported FIT files) - IMHO it's no big surprise that data from two sensors **must be different** in such a
comparison. \[_I am sorry for this rant_\].

# What values/data will be logged?

## <i class="fa-solid fa-mobile-screen-button"></i> Internal device sensors

### <i class="fa-solid fa-satellite fa-fw"></i> GPS & NMEA-Data

#### GPS/GLONASS/Galileo based location information
GPSLogger is processing [location objects](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/location/Location) provided
by the OS of your device. The app does not have much influence on the quality & frequency in which the OS is going to be
able to provide such location objects (despite the app can request to receive the location in a lower frequency then the
OS is able to provide the data).

Have said that - specially when you are **indoors**, the chances that your GPS signal is **quite bad**, is **quite high**
(this also applies if you are outdoors but surrounded by high buildings or trees).

On your device there might be alternative location information providers available (e.g. WLAN-based), **but GPSLogger is
not using them by purpose**!

The following information is stored everytime a new **gps based** location have become available to the app:
- Timestamp (in milliseconds) when the location was received on the device \[_Please note that the location object
  itself contains also a time information - this internal time information will be ignored!_\]
- Latitude
- Longitude
- Elevation in WGS84[^1] (also known as _Altitude_ or _Height_)
- Course (also known as _Heading_ or _Bearing_)
- Speed (in m/s)
- Accuracy (of the location information)
- Number of Satellites used to generate the location
- _GeoIdHeight_ (if available)[^2] 

> When you make use of the indoor rowing/treadmill functionality of GPSLogger then the device GPS signal will be ignored
> (the GPS location provider will not be requested to send any data to the app) and instead _simulated_ location objects
> based on the selected route and your current provided speed (no matter if you are rowing or running) will be created.
> In this case the stored location information is internally marked as _simulated_ by using the value -10 as _Number of
> Satellites_. Obviously no accuracy or any additional NMEA-data will be available for this type of simulated activities. 

#### NMEA Sentences
- Timestamp (in milliseconds)
- Collection of NMEA-Sentences as PLAIN-ASCII String (the device might provide multiple sentences with the identical
  timestamp)

More information about the [format and the content of NMEA-Sentences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NMEA_0183) can be
found in wikipedia.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-compass fa-fw"></i> Magnetic Sensor (if available)
You caught me - **I am a liar**! Have I said, that all sensor data will be recorded independent of each other? I am
sorry - for historic reasons this statement is not correct for the magnetic sensor data.

When a new GPS location information arrives, the original course value withing the _gps location information_ will be
overwritten with the newest (if not older than 1 sec) course value the magnetometer has provided. **Shame on me!**

### <i class="fa-solid fa-cloud-sun-rain fa-fw"></i> Barometer Sensor (if available)
- Timestamp (in milliseconds)
- Current ambient air pressure (in _hPa_ or _mbar_ \[as decimal\])
  
[Please read **Using Barometer based Elevation - Theory of operation** for further details why recording pressure
information can massively improve your logged elevation profile](../3150-elevation/#too).

### <i class="fa-solid fa-mountain fa-fw"></i> VAM Data
When you record a activity where you have loaded a navigation path **and** the app could extract climb data
([see Climb View for details](../3300-climb/)) GPSLogger will store (while you are in such a detected climb section)
multiple VAM data records in order to be able to show your _velocità ascensionale media_ (translated in English to
mean _average ascent speed_) performance after your activity.

- Timestamp (in milliseconds)
- Current VAM (ascent speed in m/s \[as decimal\])

### <i class="fa-brands fa-bluetooth fa-fw"></i> BTLE Beacons (in range)
Details about the [Build in UUID Beacon Scanner](../4000-btlescanner/) can be found in the corresponding section of this
manual.

The scanner is logging the following value (per detected beacon):
- Timestamp (in milliseconds)
- Containing data package (as plain byte[])
- Beacon type & address (as String)
  - Type and address are seperated by a @ character from each other 
  - Type can be either 0: FD6F or 1: FD64  
- RSSI (as Number \[Integer\])
- NanoSeconds (as Number \[long\])
- Total Number of visible beacons - including _the current one_ (at the time the beacon was detected for the first time) 

## <span class="material-icons" style="width: 1.042em;">sensors</span> External Sensors {#external}
Details about the currently [supported additional external sensors](../3000-sensors/) can be found in the corresponding
section of this manual. This section here covers only the data fields that will be recorded per sensor.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-heart-pulse fa-fw"></i> Heartrate Data
- Timestamp (in milliseconds)
- Current heart rate (in _beats per minute_ \[as integer\])

### <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-rotate-left fa-fw"></i> Cadence Data
- Timestamp (in milliseconds)
- Current cadence (in _revolutions per minute_ \[as integer\])

### <i class="fa-solid fa-bolt fa-fw"></i> Cycling Power-meter Data
- Timestamp (in milliseconds)
- Current power (in _WATTs_ \[as integer\])
- Power-meter index (could be 0: center, 1:left, 2:right)
- Balance between L/R (when available)

### <i class="fa-solid fa-gears fa-fw"></i> Shifting information (Shimano Di2) {#shifting}
Initially the app stores in a path the configured number of front & rear gear teeth (so when you change this gear setup
later, your recording will always include the information that was present when recording).

- Timestamp (in milliseconds)
- Front gear position (0-4)
- Rear gear position (0-14)
- Resulting gear ration (only cause of historic reasons - the data is actually obsolete)

GearShifting Data has one speciality that should be mentioned: The app will always record shifting events, even if they
occur while the app is in the **PAUSED-RECORDING** mode (so they can't be missed).

### <span class='material-icons fa-fw' style='width: 1.042em;'>rowing</span> FTMS Rower Data
- Timestamp (in milliseconds)
- _too much_ (_will be done when I even will have more time to do this_)

### <span class='material-icons fa-fw' style='width: 1.042em;'>rowing</span> Concept2 Rower Data
- Timestamp (in milliseconds)
- _way too much_ (_will be done when I even will have way more time to do this_)

# How to access / export the data
## The GPS file format
When I will be ever in the right mode, I am going to release details in GitHub. For earlier file versions there exist
external reading code - but since the changes introduced with the V6 implementation nobody seamed to be interested in an
updated version - so probably this will take some time (but the format is no secret!).

## File Export
The JSON-Export is the closest format you can get from GPSLogger - this will include (almost) all fields and data. Why
_almost_? The BTLE-Beacon information currently will **not** be written into the JSON file. Use the dedicated
CSV-Export when you want to get your hands on the BTLE Beacon data (see the
[Build in UUID Beacon Scanner](../4000-btlescanner/#export)) for details.

[^1]: WGS84 ellipsoid elevation information might not match the _Mean sea level_ (MSL) elevation information you expect
      as user! If you are interested in the details & differences of WGS84 compare to the natural elevation you might
      like to read [the 'Earth Gravitational Model' article in wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_Gravitational_Model).

[^2]: The _GeoIdHeight_ is the delta between the WGS84 elevation and the _Mean sea level_ (MSL) height (based on
      EGM2008) - This value will be extracted from the plain NMEA-sentences data (since is not provided OS location
      objects directly). The good news is, even if the value is dependant from your current location, that the
      GeoIdHeight does not change that frequent.

      So since the extraction of the value from the NMEA-sentences requires additional CPU-usage the app is extracting
      the value only every 30 seconds. Please note we accept the current present GeoIdHeight even if it's 5 minutes old
      (and the device was not able to extract a newer value).

      The option to use the EGM2008 Altitude Reference model has been introduced in GPSLogger v2.0.0.188/195 - all
      previous recorded paths does not contain a GeoIdHeight value in the location recond. In such a case the app is
      able to calculate the GeoIdHeight value by itself. This is quite some intense math-stuff and with that, expect
      some noticable delay after you load such a path into GPSLogger and General Settings > Altitude Reference
      Model <i class="fa-solid fa-toggle-on"></i>.
