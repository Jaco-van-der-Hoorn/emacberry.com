# How GPSLogger will log your data?
The core idea since the initial version of the app is, that it does not have to be actively running _with a visible
screen_ while recording. You should be able to use your device for something else - or simply carrying the device in your
pocket or bag/backpack while GPSLogger is logging the data.

## <i class="fa-solid fa-gear"></i> Running as Android-Background Service {#service}
This is already very difficult to archive - since the OS try to save as much energy (battery) as possible - while a lot
of applications does not really have the need to run always in background (e.g. apps like Instagram), GPSLogger should
always run (at least when logging).
<span class="shot">![background-service](/assets/img/gpsl/service-notification.png)</span>
Therefore, Android is offering applications to start a Background Service & Android requires that every service running
is showing the user a (sticky) notification.

### <span class="material-icons">info</span> Information for Android 10 (or later)
The Android OS have different possibilities to extend the battery life of your device - one of these possibilities is to
restrict the ability to allow apps to make use of the running-as-background-service capabilities. Of course such a
restriction will be counterproductive when using GPSLogger. So the app is requesting you to **disable the OS battery
optimization for GPSLogger** in multiple ways. For details see the FAQ:
[How to disable OS battery optimization](../1900-faq/#how2-battery-optimization)
<br class="shot-end">

## <i class="fa-solid fa-battery-three-quarters"></i> GPSLogger is designed to be battery friendly
Battery lives matters - that's one of the core principles that drives me, during the development of the application. As
developer, you have influence on the overall energy consumption of a device. So all parts of the applications have been
designed in a way to make the code as energy efficient as possible (this means to use very simple structures and almost
no frameworks).

> Just as one example: GPSLogger don't use an internal database while logging, instead the data will be directly written
into a data-output-stream. This makes the code a bit more complex, but on the other hand side this saves a lot of
CPU-cycles (and with that energy is saved).

The majority of the battery-usage of the app (while logging in the background) is caused by requesting & receiving the
GPS-signal. So by adjusting the [**GPS-update interval** in the application settings](../8000-general/#gps-settings) you
have a direct influence on the overall battery-consumption of the application - adjust it to your use case!

Have also in mind that different sensors might use additional energy - my personal observation is, that using the build
in magnetic sensor (aka compass) of my current Pixel3 phone have an almost insane negative impact on the overall battery
life - while the intense usage of the barometer sensor seams to have almost no impact. So the total battery consumption
really depends on your hardware and the settings (update frequency) you are using.

And without going too much into details here - since you might like to use different update-intervals for different use
cases the app offers a [Multi Preferences/Modes Feature](../3950-multipref) allowing you to adjust quick & easily the
settings. 

## <i class="fa-solid fa-file-code"></i> Data is stored '_as it is_' (raw)
GPSLogger is following a very simply (but strict) principle: **always keep the original data!** It's almost the nature
of GPS (and other sensor) data to be a bit flaky. It can be required for certain use-cases to apply some optimizations
(like smoothing values over a certain time period). But you don't have to be afraid, there are two very important things
you should know:

1. All calculations/manipulations will happen after the **raw source data** have been captured and stored inside the GPL
   file. So all optimizations will always happen afterward - the original data will never be altered/modified!<br/><br/>
   This ensures that when ever something will be messed up inside the application (e.g. cause of a bug) it can be
   **always** be fixed with update of the GPSLogger application!

3. All possible data post-processing can be disabled via the application setting (or needs to be enabled by the user at
   the first place). IMHO it's essential that the user can decide **if** and **when** how the sensor data should be
   manipulated. GPSLogger is **no BLACKBOX<span class="material-icons">help_center</span>** nor it does any
   **miracles <i class="fa-solid fa-wand-magic-sparkles"></i>**.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-satellite fa-fw"></i> GPS & NMEA-Data
#### GPS/GLONASS/Galileo based location information
GPSLogger is processing [location objects](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/location/Location) provided
by the OS of your device. The app does not have much influence on the quality & frequency in which the OS is going to be
able to provide such location objects (despite the app can request to receive the location in a lower frequency then the
OS is able to provide the data).

Have said that - specially when you are **indoors**, the chances that your GPS signal is **quite bad**, is **quite high**
(this also applies if you are outdoors but surrounded by high buildings or trees).

On your device there might be alternative location information providers available (e.g. WLAN-based), **but GPSLogger is
not using them by purpose**!

The following information is stored everytime a new **gps based** location have become available to the app:
- Timestamp (in milliseconds) when the location was received on the device \[_Please note that the location object
  itself contains also a time information - this internal time information will be ignored!_\]
- Latitude
- Longitude
- Elevation in WGS84[^1] (also known as _Altitude_)
- Course (also known as _Heading_ or _Bearing_)
- Speed (in m/s)
- Accuracy (of the location information)
- Number of Satellites used to generate the location
- _GeoIdHeight_ (if available)[^2] 

#### NMEA Sentences
- Timestamp (in milliseconds)

### <i class="fa-solid fa-compass fa-fw"></i> Magnetic Sensor (if available)
You caught me - **I am a liar**! Have I said, that all sensor data will be recorded independent of each other? I am
sorry - for historic reasons this statement is not correct for the magnetic sensor data.

When a new GPS location information arrives, the original course value withing the _gps location information_ will be
overwritten with the newest (if not older than 1 sec) course value the magnetometer has provided. **Shame on me!**

[^1]: WGS84 ellipsoid elevation information does not match the actual elevation information you expect as user! If you
      are interested in the details you might like to read
      [the 'Earth Gravitational Model' article in wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_Gravitational_Model).

[^2]: The _GeoIdHeight_ is the delta between the WGS84 elevation and the 'actual' (EGM2008) height - This value has to
      be extracted from the plain NMEA-sentences (since is not provided directly in the OS Location objects). Even if
      this value is dependant from your current location the good news is, that this value does not change that
      frequent.

      And since the extraction of the value from the NMEA-sentences requires additional CPU-usage the app is extracting
      this value only every 30 seconds. Please note we accept the current present GeoIdHeight even if it's 5 minutes old
      (and the device was not able to extract a newer value).
