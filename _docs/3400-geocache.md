First you have to know, that GPSLogger II supports two different ways to guide you to a certain place. In one of the
modes you will be guided directly into the direction of a previously recorded location (Location-Mode) in the second one
you will be guided along a previously loaded path (Path-Mode). It is very important that you understand the core
difference between both cases.

## Location-Mode \[Geocaching\]

The first one is suitable for geocaching or situation like finding your car in a parking lot or similar tasks. The
direction view of GPSLogger II will always point into the direction of the location that you want to reach – no matter
whether there are barriers between you and your target like buildings, rivers or canyons. So basically you have to find
the correct route (streets, paths, hikes) to your destination by yourself – so don’t simply look on your display and
walk into the direction the arrow is pointing – this might hurt (or result in a catastrophic failure :D) -
