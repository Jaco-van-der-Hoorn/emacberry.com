# Overview
GPSLogger supports different input formats for navigation turn-by-turn Information...  

The app makes use of the **online** routing engine [openrouteservice.org](https://openrouteservice.org/) (HeiGIT gGmbH).
One of the reasons why GPSLogger makes use of openrouteservice.org is simply because I had the change to be part of the
development team and contributed the current active road bike profile (beside some other internal core things).

When creating a route with openrouteservice.org the route could be directly imported into GPSLogger (as JSON) and when
the route is [loaded as navigation path (from PathManager)](../1500-pathman/#navipath)
