# Custom cassettes & cranksets/chain-rings
Even if the app has already multiple Crankset's and Cassettes defined - you might have a different setup for your Di2.
So if you miss a certain configuration you can add it here in this section.

For cassettes:
- Specify for your cassette the number of teeth for each gear. Start with the lowest number on Pos 1.

For cranksets:
- Specify for your crankset the number of teeth for each gear. Start with the largest number on Pos 1. When you just
  have a single chain ring, please specify two times the same number at Pos 1 & Pos 2.

As soon as you have a custom cassettes or cranksets configures it will show up in the settings together with a _edit_
and _delete_ button.
