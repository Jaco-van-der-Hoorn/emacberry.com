# General information about GPSLogger & this manual

## Introduction

> Initially I have started with this project in the year 2009, my first daughter was just born, and I anticipated that
> quite soon I would have to answer questions like (when we are on a walk): _What distance we have already walked?_ or
> _How long this going to take, till we are back at our home?_
> 
> In the meantime she is driving with her own car, and don't care what's her old father yelling from the backyard...
> 
> Over this period of time I have added features & functionalities I personally found valuable for my outdoor sports
> activities (like hiking or cycling) - or my indoor training (pain cave) - others have been added on request of users.
> 
> One of my main uses cases in the past few years, is to use my mobile device as bike computer replacement since I do
> not see any value spending ~600,-‚Ç¨ (or more) for a decent device, when I already have a powerful hardware with me.
> My phone has a large display, it has a decent CPU & memory, it can be online, I have a handle bar mount, and I am
> in the lucky position that I can write the code myself <i class="fa-solid fa-face-grin-squint-tears"></i>.
> 
> I don't have a single clue how many bike computers I could have bought, if I had just worked in my regular job,
> instead of investing my time into the development of GPSLogger.
