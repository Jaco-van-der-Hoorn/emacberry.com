# GUI - Graphical User Interface
The main application screen consists of:
- The Main View(s)
- The ActionBar including the main menu
- The StatusBar (can be disabled)
- The NavigationBar (if a path is loaded)

<span class="shot">![shot1](/assets/img/gpsl/Screenshot_1642149089_50.png)</span>

# The Main View(s) {#views}
The application supports up to three different views visible at the same time - the main view and two additional
Sub Views (I+II). You can:

<span class="shot">![layout](/assets/img/gpsl/view-layout.png)</span>

- Fully customize which view will be used in each of the three available sections
- [**Switch** between all the available views](#views) by **swiping left/right** (on a map view you have to start 
- swiping near the left/right margin of the map screen)
- Specify the ratio between the main- and the two sub-views (default is 1:1, the screenshot shows 3:1 - the ratio
  between Sub View I & II is always 1:1)
- Define, if a sub view should be locked (view switching will be disabled)
- The two additional views can be enabled/disabled via the main menu (_Show/Hide View 1_ and _Show/Hide View 2_)

All the view configurations can be adjusted in the [Appearance & Startup Settings](./8020-apperance.html#statup),
so that the application will start with the screen layout you prefer.

Please note that TabBar is not visible when multiple views are displayed. Then the only remaining option to change
the current view is by swiping left/right.
<br class="shot-end"/>

# The ActionBar

The ActionBar will be only visible when you are in the view-mode of the application - as soon as you start recording the
_ActionBar_ will be hidden, and you can access the  <i class="fa-solid fa-ellipsis-vertical"></i>  main menu via the
corresponding overlay button.

If there is enough space on your display the ActionBar will show (beside the
 <i class="fa-solid fa-ellipsis-vertical"></i>  menu) the
<span class="btn">![button-rec](/assets/img/gpsl/button-rec.png)</span> _Start Recording_ Button & the
<span class="btn">![button-pathman](/assets/img/gpsl/button-pathman.png)</span> [_Open PathManager_](./1500-pathman.html)
ActionButtons. 

Additionally, the action bar shows a Tab(ulator)Bar that allows you to quickly switch between the current active
main-view. Please note that the TabBar will only be shown if only the main view is active and can also be disabled via
the application settings.

When you make use of the [Multi-Preferences feature](./3950-multipref.html) the ActionBar will show the current active
profile name instead of _GPSLogger II_.

# The StatusBar

- Can be configured to be rendered as an overlay or as its own screen part
- Fields are fully customizable (including the option to toggle between the use of Emojis or Text)
  <br/>[Appearance & Startup Settings](./8020-apperance.html#statusbar)
- Showing the recording status as first entry:
  - \[L\]: logging/recording
  - \[P\]: paused (lower case \[p\] indicates that the pause was triggered by the AutoPAUSE feature)

# The NavigationBar

<span class="shot">![shot1](/assets/img/gpsl/view-navbar.png)</span>
The navigation bar is only visible when you have loaded a recorded path (or after you have stopped the recording) Beside
the slider that allows you to move quickly to any position in the recorded path (timeline) you have the option to use the
media-control-buttons:<br class="shot-end"/>

| Icon | Description |
| --- | --- |
| <span class="btn">![button-start](/assets/img/gpsl/button-nav01.png)</span> | Jump to the START of the path|
| <span class="btn">![button-fastreverse](/assets/img/gpsl/button-nav02.png)</span> | Move 15 records back |
| <span class="btn">![button-prev](/assets/img/gpsl/button-nav03.png)</span> | Move to previous record |
| <span class="btn">![button-next](/assets/img/gpsl/button-nav04.png)</span> | Move to next record |
| <span class="btn">![button-fastforward](/assets/img/gpsl/button-nav05.png)</span> | Move 15 records forward |
| <span class="btn">![button-end](/assets/img/gpsl/button-nav06.png)</span> | Jump to the END of the path |

Please note, that not all records have to be location records - so moving one record backwards/forwards might just
select a different record type (see [How GPSLogger will log your data?](./1100-data.html#independant))

# Additional Overlay Buttons
The app wil show some additional buttons as overlay over the Main View - the appearance of each depends on the
current use case and logging state. E.g. the <span class="btn">![button-men](/assets/img/gpsl/button-menu.png)</span>
will be only shown when the app is recording (and the ActionBar is hidden). 

| Icon | Description |
| --- | --- |
| <span class="btn">![button-men](/assets/img/gpsl/button-menu.png)</span> | Opening the  <i class="fa-solid fa-ellipsis-vertical"></i>  main menu of the application |
| <span class="btn">![button-rot](/assets/img/gpsl/button-rotation-small.png)</span> | The compass, in the upper left corner of the map, can be used in order to toggle the map orientation: _Always North_ or _Current Heading_ |
| <span class="btn">![button-pau](/assets/img/gpsl/button-pause.png)</span> | Pause the current recording (when the recording is paused the overlay button will pulse slightly) |
| <span class="btn">![button-sto](/assets/img/gpsl/button-stop.png)</span> | Stop the current recording (only visible if device is not in <i class="fa-solid fa-lock"></i> lock state) |
| <span class="btn">![button-omd](/assets/img/gpsl/button-omd.png)</span> | Alternate between the different configured [OpenMapData Providers](./2200-openmapdata.html) |
| <span class="btn">![button-pan](/assets/img/gpsl/button-resetpan.png)</span> | Center map on current position (only visible if map view is panned) |
| <span class="btn">![button-fla](/assets/img/gpsl/button-mflag.png)</span> | Center map on next (navigation) target (only active when a navigation path is loaded) |
| <span class="btn">![button-zin](/assets/img/gpsl/button-zoomin.png)</span> | Zoom IN (only visible if one of the visible views supports zoom function) <i class="fa-solid fa-hand-point-up fa-fw"></i> Pinch-to-zoom is also supported |
| <span class="btn">![button-zou](/assets/img/gpsl/button-zoomout.png)</span> | Zoom OUT (only visible if one of the visible views supports zoom function) <i class="fa-solid fa-hand-point-up fa-fw"></i> Pinch-to-zoom is also supported |
| <span class="btn">![button-nav](/assets/img/gpsl/button-resetnav.png)</span> | Reset Off-road Navigation (only available if a navigation path is loaded that does not contain turn-by-turn instructions) |
| <span class="btn">![button-nxt](/assets/img/gpsl/button-nextwp.png)</span> | [Calculate new next Waypoint](./2500-offroadnav.html#nextwaypoint) (only available if a navigation path is loaded that does not contain turn-by-turn instructions) |

# The available Views {#views}

In the following section some sample screenshots of the different views can show overlay buttons, others do not. The
appearance of the overlay buttons can depend on the visibility of a certain view but **don't have too**. In the
following sections the overlay buttons will not be described - since they might not necessarily belong to the view.

## OpenMapData View

GPSLogger has two different Map views implemented - depending on your Android Version and your device you can use the
vector data based map rendering or an image based map rendering.

### Vector tile based (using native   OpenGL)

GPSLogger makes use of the VTM (Vector Tile Map), that was developed within the OpenScienceMap project. VTM makes use of 
OpenGL which implies that it is extremely fast. The [VTM library is provided by mapsforge](https://github.com/mapsforge/vtm).

<span class="shot">![a](/assets/img/gpsl/view-map-vtm.png)</span>
**Map features & interactions:** 
- The map image will be generated on the fly using OpenGL
- The map can be zoomed seamlessly  
- The map can be rotated (textual information will be aligned based on the rotation)
- The map can be tilted (touch & hold with two fingers & move fingers up or down)
- Buildings will be rendered in 3D
- Also supporting image tiles \[of course with the limits of image based map data (zoom steps, suboptimal text display
  and other things)\]

<br class="shot-end"/>
**To use the full power of the VTM map you should use an open map data provider that will deliver vector tile data. This is
either the _OSM OpenMapVectorTiles (online)_ provider (mapzen) or the _OpenStreetMap (Offline)_ provider (working with
local *.map files).** [Details about the different map tiles provider can be found in the OMD Section of this manual.](./2200-openmapdata.html#map-types)

When you use the OpenMapData provider called **OpenStreetMap (Offline)**, then the map will be created on the basis of a so
called _Render Theme_. In such a theme the styling of each part of the map is defined (streets, rivers, bridges,
tunnels, land usage, etc...). A Render Theme can have its own options that would allow you to select different layers or
even language preferences that should be visible on your map (see [Render Themes for details](./2300-osmoffline.html#themes)).

<span class="material-icons fa-fw">info</span> The VTM Map is only usable as the _Main View_ of GPSLogger. The Secondary
View I+II uses the second type of the map view.

> I did not manage to implement 3 different VTM maps on a single screen, running simultaneously without any
> stability issues. That's the reason why I decided on this workaround (VTM Map only in the Main View).

The simplest way to distinguish between the two different map versions is the compass in the upper left corner - if it's
the complex compass image then it's the VTM map, if it's the simpler _black arrow_, then you are dealing with the image
tile based map version.

### Image Tile based

This map view uses pixel based images to display a map. The map will be assembled from multiple images - so called
_tiles_. This tile image can have two different sources:

- Online Image Tile Server
- Images created from locally stored *.map files (via the [Mapsforge library](https://github.com/mapsforge/mapsforge))

No matter if you use an online tile server or the local created images - once GPSLogger has downloaded or created a
tile image it will be locally cached in an internal database, so it can be reused later. This means that you are able to
use an _online_ OpenMapData Provider even when you are offline, if all the required image tiles of a specific region are
already stored in your local cache.

<!--The Application supports multiple options to _pre-download_ or _pre-generate_ tiles for a certain area.-->

**Supported map interactions:**
- The map can be zoomed in steps (since each zoom level has half/double the resolution of its predecessor) 
- The map can be rotated (but since the image is pixel based the texts will also be rotated as they are)
- The map can be panned (only if the map is aligned to North - so you can **either** _rotate_ **or** _pan_) 

#### Online Image Tile Server

<span class="shot">![a](/assets/img/gpsl/view-map-def01.png)</span>
Here on this screenshot you see the OpenStreetMap Carto Style from their non public tile server ([see OSM Tile Usage
Policy](https://operations.osmfoundation.org/policies/tiles/)).

In general every TileServer that delivers images (in the required projection) can be configured & used with GPSLogger as
long as the server supports public http(s) access.
<br class="shot-end"/>

#### Mapsforge (OSM Offline *.map files)

When you use the OpenMapData provider called **OpenStreetMap (Offline)**, then the image tiles will be created with the
help of a so called _Render Theme_ via the [Mapsforge library](https://github.com/mapsforge/mapsforge) **locally on your
device**. In the render theme the styling of each part of the map is defined (streets, rivers, bridges, tunnels, land
usage, etc...). A Render Theme can have its own options that would allow you to select different layers or even language
preferences that should be visible on your map (see [Render Themes for details](./2300-osmoffline.html#themes)).

<span class="shot">![a](/assets/img/gpsl/view-map-def02.png)</span>
Here in this example screenshot you see the Elevate Render-Theme (created & maintained [by Tobias Kühn](https://www.openandromaps.org/en/legend/elevate-mountain-hike-theme)) 
<br class="shot-end"/>

## Compass View
<span class="shot">![a](/assets/img/gpsl/view-compass.png)</span>
A _very basic_ view - displaying your current direction, where the needle is static (pointing up) and
the <span style="color:red">**N**</span> is pointing into the direction of the magnetic north. When your device has a
built in magnetic sensor then the app can behave like a physical compass. 

> My personal experience with the magnetic sensor is, that the overall power consumption is significant higher when the
> sensor is enabled in the application settings, It can be very useful e.g. when GeoCaching but it really depends on
> your individual use case (if it's worth the additional power consumption).

Special Thanks to Rob Antonishen for the very nice compass svg file and granting the permission to use it in the app.
<br class="shot-end"/>

## Speed View {#speed}

Speed information based on the GPS signal ~~can be~~ is very flaky. In order to smooth out the noise in the GPS speed
information GPSLogger applies by default an _average median calculation_ when displaying the speed information. The grey
graph always shows you the result of this internal calculation. \[Taking the set of the last max. 10 speed values, order
them, remove the first and the last (so removing the min. & max.) and then calculate the average value of the remaining
set.\]. You can disable the speed smoothing via Application Settings > General Settings > GPS-Sensor & Smoothing
Settings > Smooth Speed <i class="fa-solid fa-toggle-off fa-fw"></i>

<span class="shot">![a](/assets/img/gpsl/view-speed.png)</span>
- Graph red: Showing average speed over time (always calculated based on overall distance & overall duration)
- other: depends on the combination of two application settings -> see table below
<br class="shot-end"/>

| Overwrite GPS-Speed | Smooth Speed | Graph: | Graph blue:
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| <i class="fa-solid fa-toggle-off fa-fw"></i> | <i class="fa-solid fa-toggle-off fa-fw"></i> | Speed information from the GPS fix | -none- |
| <i class="fa-solid fa-toggle-on fa-fw"></i> | <i class="fa-solid fa-toggle-off fa-fw"></i> | Speed information based on the distance & time | Speed information from the GPS fix |
| <i class="fa-solid fa-toggle-off fa-fw"></i> | <i class="fa-solid fa-toggle-on fa-fw"></i> | Average median speed value (from GPS fix) of max. last 10 sec.| Speed information from the GPS fix |
| <i class="fa-solid fa-toggle-on fa-fw"></i> | <i class="fa-solid fa-toggle-on fa-fw"></i> | Average median speed value (from distance & time) of max. last 10 sec.| Speed information based on the distance & time |

<span class="shot">![a](/assets/img/gpsl/view-speed-zoom.png)</span>
The difference between calculated median speed and the original GPS speed is not really noticeable in the overall view -
but when you start to zoom in, you can see the difference (it's very typical that the original gps speed is jumping
up & down).<br class="shot-end"/>

## Elevation View

Elevation information from the GPS signal can have multiple issues. The challenges are different compared to speed data,
but the overall challenge remains the same: the original data is not really suitable to be displayed 1:1. Details about
the possibilities to enhance elevation data can be found in the [<span class='material-icons'>show_chart</span>
Elevation Data optimizations section](./3250-elevation.html#too).

<span class="shot">![a](/assets/img/gpsl/view-alt.png)</span>
- Graph: Showing elevation data over time
- Graph red: Showing slope/grade over time (min/max -/+33%)
- Graph blue: **If** present, showing the original elevation data from the GPS Sensor. This is the case, if in the
  Barometer Sensor settings _Use as Elevation provider_ <i class="fa-solid fa-toggle-on fa-fw"></i> or if additional
  smoothing will be applied after path loading<br class="shot-end"/>

## Direction View
<span class="shot">![a](/assets/img/gpsl/view-dir.png)</span>
- The compass rose <span style="color:red">**N**</span> is pointing into the direction of the magnetic north.
- The compass needle is pointing in the direction (as the crow flies) of your target (assuming you hold the device
  right in front of you)
- Upper left corner: Total distance to destination
- Upper right corner: Estimated time of arrival at destination (When you are currently moving faster than the
  average speed you will see an arrow pointing down, indicating that the _estimated time of arrival_ might be lower, or
  an arrow pointing upwards to indicate that the time might be higher when your speed continues to be less than the
  overall average speed)
- Lower left corner top: Course to target waypoint
- Lower left corner bottom: Relative speed to target waypoint
- Lower right corner top: Estimated time of arrival at target waypoint
- Lower right corner bottom: Distance to target waypoint

<br class="shot-end"/>

## GPS-Data View
When you want to use GPSLogger as a simple GPS display, this is probably the view you would like to use. The view will
display the current latitude and longitudes values (depending on your selected format) in the largest possible font so
that both values are completely displayable on the selected screen size.

<span class="shot">![a](/assets/img/gpsl/view-gps.png)</span>
- 1st row (maximum possible font size): Current **Latitude**
- 2nd row (maximum possible font size): Current **Longitude**
- Lower left corner: Current Speed (without unit)
- Lower right corner: Current Course
<br class="shot-end"/>

<span class="shot">![a](/assets/img/gpsl/view-gps-landscape.png)</span>
You probably want to use this View as a stand alone e.g. in your cockpit (boat - not aircraft!) in landscape mode to get the
maximum font size possible.
<br class="shot-end"/>

## Navigation Views
Before the Multi View I-IV were available GPSLogger had only the ability to display 3 different views at the same
time (Main view & SubView I+II). The three available Navigation views have been implemented in order to allow the user
to configure the screen depending on his personal use case. All the available information is also available as part of
the MultiViews. [See <i class="fa-solid fa-window-restore"></i> Multi View I - Multi View IV Section for details.](./3150-multiviews.html)

### Direction View
Of course the _core_ is the _direction-to-go_ pointing arrow. This view assumes, that you have your device in front of
you while moving (actively looking onto the device display).

<span class="shot">![a](/assets/img/gpsl/view-nav-dir.png)</span>
- Arrow: pointing in the direction (as the crow flies) of the next navigation target (can be a TurnByTurn position or 
  an Off-road navigation waypoint)
- Medium Font middle: Distance to the waypoint
- Medium Font bottom: Remaining overall distance after the waypoint
<br class="shot-end"/>

### Distance & Timing View
<span class="shot">![a](/assets/img/gpsl/view-nav-dist.png)</span>
- Medium Font top: Total distance/length
- Medium Font middle: Total time/duration
- Medium Font bottom: Average speed (without unit - so here in the example 53,8 km/h) 
<br class="shot-end"/>

### Speed View
<span class="shot">![a](/assets/img/gpsl/view-nav-speed.png)</span>
- Large Font top: Current Speed
- Large Font bottom: Speed unit
<br class="shot-end"/>

## Power View (BTLE)
Data for the Power View is only available if you have paired an BluetoothLE Power Sensor with GPSLogger. [Please see
<span class="material-icons" style='margin-top:0.1em;'>sensors</span> External Sensors / Cycling Power for details.](./3000-sensors.html#pow)

<span class="shot">![a](/assets/img/gpsl/view-pow.png)</span>
- Large Font top: Current cycling power
- Medium Font middle: Current ratio between left & right leg (balance - here in the example left leg provided 51%,
  while right delivered _just_ 49% of the 263 watts)
- Medium Font bottom: the average balance between left & right (here in the example the right leg provided on average
  6.07% more power than the left)
- Graph: Showing cycling power over time
- Graph red: Showing the average power
- Graph blue: Showing the balance between left & right leg over time (lower than half of the screen: left leg provided
  more power, over the half of the screen: right leg provided more power) 
<br class="shot-end"/>

## Barometer View
Data for the Barometer View is only available if your device have a built in barometer sensor and if you have enabled
the Barometer Sensor in the Application settings.

<span class="shot">![a](/assets/img/gpsl/view-baro.png)</span>
- Large Font: Showing current pressure in millibars
- Graph: Showing pressure over time

Here in the sample screenshot you also see how a pause in the recording data will be rendered in the different time axis
based views. In this example the pause took 1 minute and 30 seconds.
<br class="shot-end"/>

## TargetSpeed View
Implemented for a specific use case of a friend - mainly to give you a target speed based on the current slope. 

## Climb View

<br class="shot-end"/>

## BTLE-Beacon View
Data for the BTLE-Beacon View is only available if you have enabled the built in BluetoothLowEnergy beacon scanner **and**
you have started the recording process. [Please see <i class="fa-brands fa-bluetooth"></i> Build in BluetoothLowEnergy
Beacon Scanner for details.](4000-btlescanner.html)

<span class="shot">![view-btle-beacons](/assets/img/gpsl/view-btle-beacons.png)</span>
- Large Font: Showing current visible beacons 
- Graph: Showing number of visible beacons over time
<br class="shot-end"/>

## Path View

The _Path View_ is the initial created view of GPSLogger - so everything has started from here. In the first days of
the application there was almost no map support on the BlackBerry Platform available. So the initial approach of
GPSLogger was to show the user a x-y-axis graph of his path. This might also explain, why the activities/tracks/routes
that you record with the app have the internal name _path_.)

<span class="shot">![a](/assets/img/gpsl/view-path.png)</span> The Path view is drawing the latitude/longitude positions
on a simple X/Y axis **without any projection**. This means, that each pixel on the display has a different length or
height in the real world.

This seems to be ridiculously bad from today's point of view - but hey _I was young and needed the money!_ What else can I
say, a lame excuse. Seriously this view is just included in GPSLogger for nostalgic reasons. I don't expect that any
current user has this view enabled.

The Path View does not allow much user interaction - zoom in & zoom out, that's it basiaclly - even a pan option is not
available in this initial view.
<br class="shot-end"/>

<span class="shot">![a](/assets/img/gpsl/view-path-compare.png)</span>If you want to have an accurate view of your
path (map projection wise), please use the OpenMapData View with the **OpenStreetMap (Offline)** provider - when you do not
have any additional *map files in your offline maps directory (only the world.map present), then the presentation of the
OpenMapData View is the view you should use. It's also 100% offline.

When you compare both screenshots here the difference is quite noticeable! (Even if you ignore all the other differences
like: compass, map attribution or the different styling of path & background-path rendering.)<br class="shot-end"/>
