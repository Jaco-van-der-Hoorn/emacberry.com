At the beginning of 2020 I came across multiple challenges... Despite COVID-19 of course. Currently, GPSLoggerÂ II makes
use of the free vector tile server [nextzen.org](https://www.nextzen.org/) - even if there exist some alternatives to
this service, these alternatives require an account - and with that a certain payment for the usage.

Since GPSLogger is free (and I don't want to change this in the future) I felt the need to prepare a nextzen.org
source alternative. And obviously the 'only' possible solution would be to host vector map data by myself.

Challenge accepted!<br class="shot-end"/><!--more-->

## Overview
My main goal of ths project is to become independent of the internet giants Google, Apple or Microsoft when it comes to
map services.

## Key Feature/Functions
- **No** user tracking / **No** cookies
- Complete world coverage (monthly updates)
- Free rotatable and tilt-able (since this is all vector data)
- 3D buildings
- Localized names (your browser language)
- POIs (point of interest)
- Rendering SAC- & MTB-Scales
- Self generated hill shades & contours
- Powerful search (powered by an own [Pelias](https://github.com/pelias/pelias) instance)
    - autocomplete / suggestions
    - regional sub-search
    - search in specific range on map
    - configurable search layers & sources
     
### Used (Re)Sources    
- based on the [openmaptiles](https://github.com/openmaptiles/openmaptiles) project
- using [tegola](https://tegola.io/) as tile server
- running on Postgres approx. ~300 GB

### Link
It's currently hosted @ my private server - running at home and the connection is just a regular DSL-line - so don't
expect a performance miracle [myMap hosted @ emac.de](https://maps.emac.de/)
